Resources :books: to guide the training ***Development Lifecycle: CI/CD*** from [KeepCoding](https://keepcoding.io/) DevOps bootcamp.

> Part 1 out of 4: Local Pipelines :round_pushpin: 

## Requirements :point_down: 
- make (Check that `make --version` in your terminal outputs something like `GNU Make 4.X [...]`)
- python3 (Check that `python --version` in your terminal outputs something like `Python 3.X.X`)
- pip3 (Check that `pip --version` in your terminal outputs something like `pip 20.X.X from [...] (python 3.X)`)
- docker (Check that  `docker run hello-world` works)
- A [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/) account
- A session on docker hub open in the terminal with `docker login`
- A [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) account

## TODO
- Script order define
- Test python app in local
- Know difference between "build" and "python 3 -m build"
- Why it doesn't take the pypirc configuration
- Know if we are going to use PyPI or TestPyPI
